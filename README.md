""Securely Access Your Assets with Unmatched Privacy: Experience Next-Level Protection with our ZKP Based 2FA Account Abstraction Wallet""

problem it solves : Currently, the main obstacle to bringing more people on board with Web3 is the uncertainty
and fear of losing all assets due to the ease with which transfers can be made just by having
knowledge of the private key. In the past, even highly skilled developers have made
mistakes and accidentally exposed their private keys to the public, which has resulted in
unfortunate consequences. 

If there was a confirmation feature similar to 2FA in Web2 that allowed for added security without compromising anonymity,
it would be highly beneficial. Getting inspired from the eth-infinitism account abstraction implementation and 
ZKotp we  have tried to implement the same thing by confirming the initiation of a transaction only when a 
2nd factor pin is entered which is generated by the google authenticator. 

In the future, if someone's account is hacked by accident, they can be assured that our
wallet will provide an added layer of security by requiring an OTP. If the OTP is not provided,
the user will be notified of any suspicious transaction activity, allowing them to take
appropriate action.
